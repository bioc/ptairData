Description: The package ptairData contains two proton-transfer-reaction quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer 
    (PTR-TOF-MS) raw datasets in hdf5 format: one of exhaled air from two volunteer healthy individuals, and one of cell culture 
    headspace of two species and one control (culture medium). Those datasets are used for run examples and vignette 
    of ptairMS (PTR-TOF-MS data preprocessing package).
