Title: PTR-TOF-MS volatolomics raw datasets from exhaled air and cell culture headspace
Version: 1.11.0

Description: The package ptairData contains two raw datasets from 
   Proton-Transfer-Reaction Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer acquisitions (PTR-TOF-MS), 
   in the HDF5 format. One from the exhaled air of two volunteer healthy 
   individuals with three replicates, and one from the cell culture headspace 
   from two mycobacteria species and one control (culture medium only) with two 
   replicates. Those datasets are used in the examples and in the vignette of 
   the ptairMS package (PTR-TOF-MS data pre-processing). There are also used to
   gererate the ptrSet in the ptairMS data : exhaledPtrset and mycobacteriaSet
